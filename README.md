Pode is a Cross-Platform framework to create web servers that host REST APIs, Web Sites, and TCP/SMTP Servers. It also allows you to render dynamic files using .pode files, which is effectively embedded PowerShell, or other Third-Party template engines. Pode also has support for middleware, sessions, authentication, and logging; as well as access and rate limiting features. There's also Azure Functions and AWS Lambda support!
